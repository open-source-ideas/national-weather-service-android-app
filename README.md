# National Weather Service Android app

_Based on [the idea](https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas/issues/74) submitted by @xenotropic_

_Excerpt from original issue:_

> The app I am proposing would pull data from the NWS API , and display it somehow on an android phone. Even just displaying textual data for the users location (or user-submitted location) would be a contribution. More advanced would be to integrate icons, and more advanced displays. I think there is even radar data that can be displayed, but that would be even more advanced. Ideally would show current conditions as well as forecast.
